Cd Collection is a web application in which you can keep track of your cd collection. 

Here are a few short steps to get you started...

Software in package:
- Cd Collection Web Application
- GlassFish5
- Derby DB

0. Prerequisite
===============

GlassFish 5.0 requires Oracle JDK 8 Update 144.
Check http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html to download the JDK.


1. Starting Cd Collection Web Application
=======================

Running the application is just a matter of unzipping the CdCollection archive in the desired directory and running the batchfile 'start.bat'. After about 30 seconds (depending on machine), GlassFish will be up and ready to accept requests. The Cd Collection domain is configured to listen on port 8080. In your browser, go to http://localhost:8080/CdCollectionWeb to see the landing page.

2. Stopping Cd Collection Web Application

Run the batchfile 'stop.bat' to stop GlassFish and Derby.
